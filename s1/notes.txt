Introduction to laravel:

1. Define Framework
2. Define Laravel
3. Set up a Laravel Project
4. Define MVC (Model-View-Controllers), architectural pattern of framework.
5, Define Routes, Views and Controllers


--------------------------------------------
What is a Framework?
	- a software tool that provides a way to build and run web applications. As a result, you don't need to write code on your own and waste time looking for possible miscalculations and bugs.

What is Laravel?
	Laravel is a web application framework with expressivee, elegant syntax.
	Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in majority of wev projects, such as authentication (Registration page & Login page), routing (localhost:8000/login.php -> localhost:8000/login), session and caching.

How to set up laravel project?
	1. Is Composer already installed?
		Composer - package manager of php, this where the dependencies/files/folders needed for our laravel project.

		Go to getcomposer.org

		To check:
			Open your gitbash/terminal
			Then run 'composer' * this should return a a composer logo and its version

	2. Create the laravel app:

		Open your terminal
		Then run the command below:

		composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist <app-name>

		ex. composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist laravel-template

What is MVC?
	Model Views Controllers - architectural pattern seaparates the application into three main logical components

	Model - holds the data, represents the data inside the database
			Location: app/

	Views - Front end, it holds the User interface
			Location: resources/views/

			We use blade template to create views for our laravel app.
			We create views with a file extension .blade.php
				ex. login.blade.php

	Controllers - Back end, creates functions for our application
			Location: app/Http/Controllers/


Routes - used to create the routes/url for our application
		Location: routes/web.php
Migrations - used to create a blueprint for our tables
		Location: database/migrations/

--------------------------------------------------------------
PHP ARTISAN: Command line of Laravel

To create a controller:
	php artisan make:controller ProfileController

To create a Migration:
	php artisan make:migration create_nameoftableinpluralform_table
	ex.
	php artisan make:migration create_profiles_table

To add a column in an existing migration in our database:
	php artisan make:migration add_columnname_to_tablename_table --table=tablename
	ex.
	php artisan make:migration add_status_to_task_table --table=tasks

To migrate the migrations:
	php artisan migrate

To rollback the migrations:
	php artisan migrate: rollback

To create a Model:
	php artisan make:model Modelnameinsingularform
	ex.
	php artisan make:model Profile

To create a Model and Migration at the same time
	php artisan make:model Modelnamesingularform -m (-m is for migration)
	ex.
	php artisan make:model Profile -m (this will create model first, then migration)

To create a Model, migration and controller at the same time:
	php artisan make:model Modelname -m -c (or -mc)
	ex.
	php artisan make:model Profile -m -c (this will create a model first, then a migration, then a controller)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Establishing the connection of mysql to our laravel app
1. Find the .env file and open 
2. Go to line of code 9 to 14 then update the following:

	DB_CONNECTION=mysql
	DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 or remotemysql.com
	DB_PORT=3306
	DB_DATABASE=<name of database>
	DB_USERNAME=root
	DB_PASSWORD=

3. Create tables using migrations
4. Modify the migrations
5. Then migrate


---------------------------------------------------------------
Model 

	Ex.
		Mobile Phone - Brand name
					 - Color 
					 - Unit Number
					 - Memory
					 - Processor
					 - Camera
					 - Screen Size
					 - What is the functionalities?

		If we create a new Mobile Phone it should have the following characteristics above.

		Mobile Phone - B56-Super-Mobile
					 - Hot Pink
					 - B56-021920
					 - 12GB RAM, 1TB ROM
					 - Snap Dragon 865
					 - Front Camera 24 Mega Pixels, Back Camera 64 megapixels
					 - 6.4 Full view display
					 - Can make holographic call, text, touchID for security, wireless charing, teleporting, Anti Covid Phone
		
		*Now this record (Mobile phone b56-super-mobile) is a representation of a Model

-------------------------------------------------------------------
PHP TINKER - is a quick and easy way to communicate with our data inside the database
		   - It's a laravel interactive language shell, a way to do the repl (read-eval-print-loop)

Steps to start and CRUD records under PHP Tinker:
1. Open your laravel-project's terminal/gitbash
2. Run command: php artisan Tinker
3. Then follow the steps on the images that I pushed on S2/

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Laravel Todo list app

1. Create the project 
2. Create the database
3. List down the possible migrations:
	tasks - id, task_name (string), task_time (timestamp), due_date (timestamp), priority_id (unsginedBigInteger), user_id (unsignedBigInteger), timestamps
	priorities - id, priority_name (string), timestamps
4. Create the migrations and models

CRUD using PHP Tinker
Instructions
1. Open your gitbash/terminal on your laravel app.
2. Run PHP Tinker
3. Then add the following records on your users table, tasks table, and priorities table:

	users table:
		name, email, password 
	Please insert the ff:
		John Doe, johndoe@mail.com, Hash::make('johndoe123')


	priorities table:
	Please insert the ff:

		Low Level
	
	tasks table:
		task_name, task_time, priority_id, user_id
	Please insert the ff:
		1. Wake up, 05/06/2020 5:30, High Level, John Doe
		2. Eat Breakfast, 05/06/2020 7:30, High Level, John Doe

CRUD functionalities using Models, Views, Controller and Routes
1. Create the necessary migrations and models.
2. Set up the database using .env (line of code no. 9-14)
3. Create views/blade file for our page, then create the necessary forms (creating records), list items(retrieving records).
4. Create a method under our controller that will return the necessary views/blade.
5. Register a route that will call the method under the controller.

*Notes to remember when using forms for CRUD functionalities
	1. Make sure that you a form "action" and "method", if you have file uploads add the "enctype=multipart/formdata"
	2. Use the '@csrf' token for security purposes otherwise if you submit your form-data it will return 419|Page Expired
	3. Use the '@method('')' field (method spoofing) for DELETE and PUT/PATCH method.
		*Our HTML forms does not support PUT/PATCH and DELETE. So when we are to DELETE or PUT/PATCH(update) our records we have to trick our HTML form methods to recognize it.
	4. Use the necessary Route methods which are:
		if we are to retrieve records/pages, we use the Route::get('url', 'Controller@method');
		if we are to create records or send data to controllers using form, we use the Route::post('url', Controller@method);
		if we are to delete records, we use the Route::delete('url', 'Controller@method');
			*make sure on the part that when using the route delete, we also use the @method('DELETE') field on our form
		if we are to update records, we use the Route::put('url', 'Controller@method') or Route::patch('url', 'Controller@method');
			*make sure that when we are using the route put/patch, we also use the @method('PUT') or @method('PATCH') field on our form
		What's the difference between PUT and PATCH?
			PUT - replace the whole record
			PATCH - modify the attributes of the records
				If we update the user's firstname and lastname using Patch method, it will update on the firstname and lastname field.
				However if use the Put method, the whole record will be updated as if it is a new record.
