5, Define Routes, Views and Controllers


--------------------------------------------
What is a Framework?
	- a software tool that provides a way to build and run web applications. As a result, you don't need to write code on your own and waste time looking for possible miscalculations and bugs.

What is Laravel?
	Laravel is a web application framework with expressivee, elegant syntax.
	Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in majority of wev projects, such as authentication (Registration page & Login page), routing (localhost:8000/login.php -> localhost:8000/login), session and caching.

How to set up laravel project?
	1. Is Composer already installed?
		Composer - package manager of php, this where the dependencies/files/folders needed for our laravel project.

		Go to getcomposer.org

		To check:
			Open your gitbash/terminal
			Then run 'composer' * this should return a a composer logo and its version

	2. Create the laravel app:

		Open your terminal
		Then run the command below:

		composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist <app-name>

		ex. composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist laravel-template

What is MVC?
	Model Views Controllers - architectural pattern seaparates the application into three main logical components

	Model - holds the data, represents the data inside the database
			Location: app/

	Views - Front end, it holds the User interface
			Location: resources/views/

			We use blade template to create views for our laravel app.
			We create views with a file extension .blade.php
				ex. login.blade.php

	Controllers - Back end, creates functions for our application
			Location: app/Http/Controllers/


Routes - used to create the routes/url for our application
		Location: routes/web.php
Migrations - used to create a blueprint for our tables
		Location: database/migrations/

PHP ARTISAN: Command line of Laravel

To create a controller:
	php artisan make:controller ProfileController
